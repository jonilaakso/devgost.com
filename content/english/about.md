Greetins, and welcome to my blog!

## Who is this guy?

My name is Joni and I'm from Finland. 

## What is he doing here?

This site is my way of documenting my learning journey in the world of technology. I started this blog after my freshly made [Youtube-channel](https://www.youtube.com/@devgost). My idea is to make videos and write this blog at the same time.

## What is he going to do?

I going to learn new things about technology and share my knowledge on the way. Devgost blog and yt-channel is made to support and to motivate. At the same time, it would be nice to find like-minded people.

## How can he be contacted?
